## About dayflow

dayflow is your personal scheduling online service, designed to simplify your daily routines and enhance your productivity. Our platform empowers users to create "flows" that automatically schedule their days based on their routines. You can organize your day with precision by placing "Time Buckets" for different activity types, be it work-related or personal.

### What Sets Us Apart

- **Integration with Calendar and Task Management Tools:** Seamlessly connect your favorite calendar and task management tools with dayflow, ensuring all your tasks and appointments are in sync.

- **Journaling and Self-Reflection:** We believe in the power of self-reflection. dayflow offers built-in journaling features to help you reflect on your day, set goals, and track your progress.
